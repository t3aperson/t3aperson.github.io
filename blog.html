   <h1>Why The 7th Generation of Games Consoles are as olid choice if you hate the internet. - 10/25/25</h1>
<p>Recently I got back into the gaming consoels frmo when I was young, PS3, Xbox 360, and the Wii. I'll be honest most of these consoles did not age that well compared to the game consoles we have know. Like outside of Wii Play, Wii Sports, and Wii Fit Plus (Which I do actually plan on running a test to see if I can actually lose weight using so look out for that) Most of the games are boring, but the PS3 and Xbox 360 sent me for a run and had me surprised. The games still look good, they run good on the consoles they were made for, and Physical media support and hell if you need it. They both run Youtube and Netflix. The PS3 though runs it way better. The youtube app is smooth and supports Youtube Shorts, The Netflix app also runs just great and plays 1080p just fine. The Xbox 360 app does not support Youtube Shorts, and is slower, same thing with the Netflix App, It's super slow and buggy. The thing is this is about why these are great if you don't really wanna be connected to the internet. You wanna get away, and these are great. You have a big catalog of game, the ability to watch your physical movie collection on these, and have your games physically where they can't be taken away well unless you got something along the lines of disc rot or your lens either started to fail or in the case of my Xbox 360 get really dirty, but you can always fix that. You will lose stuff like multiplayer achivements and stuff but if you really wanna just be isolated from the internet or want devices that wont shove ads and internet down your face. Buy a PS3 or an Xbox 360. You will thank me later.</p>
