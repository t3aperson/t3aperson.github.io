   <h1>I miss neocities. - 9/16/25</h1>
<p>I switched here to github pages not that long ago because both neocities and nekoweb do not support custom domains and make you pay a free for no reason, and to keep everything together. I had to switch. but now that since I've switched I miss the old community tha twas neocities. Neocities has such a vibrant community way better then nekoweb github pages or any static hosting website, and switching that I have now been basically, in a way, "excommunicated" from that community due to my switch. I get why I was. But I sitll miss neocities but the idea that custom domains are paid but also having a ".neocities.org" is seen as lesser because you don't have that "raw programmer" type website also makes me upset. People had customd omains too when they used geocities to make themselves unique or if someone already had that domain on the hosting website. I don't feel that on neocities. I feel like as if it's trying to be a unique club. and I really like my domain. It makes me happy.</p>
